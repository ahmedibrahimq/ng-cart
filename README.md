## Learn Angular
I build this project to learn Angular. I've learned Angular by:
1. Getting started with [Angular & TypeScript] by Mosh Hamedani.
2. [Build your first Angular app] massive tutorial by Dan Wahlin | Scrimba.
3. It is the time for the [docs].
4. Take notes (do not copy & paste). Here are [my Angular notes].
5. Build an app
   1. Start from an idea or clone a popular app
   2. Apply new things. Do not stick around what you have already learned.
   3. Do not stop much at the UI. Done is better than perfect.
   4. Complete the project to the end.
   5. In the end, optimize your code.
